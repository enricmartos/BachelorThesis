# BachelorThesis - Sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews

This repository will contain the main Python scripts of my Bachelor Thesis (Sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews).

# Abstract

Text mining has proved to be a crucial tool for companies in order to know their customers opinion. By deriving high-quality information from large volumes of text, itâ€™s possible to understand how the market preferences evolve beyond sales stats. For this reason, the goal of this bachelor thesis is to perform an accurate sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Three different review datasets (ebooks, video games and toys) will configure the starting point to extract and quantify affective states and subjective information. The mentioned datasets are provided by Kaggle, a collaborative data science and machine learning platform. Natural language processing plays a fundamental role, since another main purpose is to deduce how people rate the usefulness of a review for each category.

# Goals

1. Prediction of the dominant sentiment behind each review: Considering that each review has its own overall field, we can use it to evaluate the accuracy of our model by comparing our output with the real value.

2. Prediction of the helpfulness of a review: This is a similar case as the previous one, but now we are going to predict how helpful a given review can be based on its body of text. We can use the helpful field to evaluate our model accuracy as well.

3. Sentiment analysis from a deep learning approach: Word Vectors are based on a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. The idea is to check the performance of a deep learning algorithm that works with unlabeled data and the same time is able to to create meaningful representations.
